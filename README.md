# Experience

### Intern at HoH Start-up
I worked as a intern at **HoH e-commerce start-up** company for 2 months, In that two months I built two application for the company. 
- One application uses RAG model to created SEO friendly blogs to highlight and increase the companies brand visibilty.
- Other was a DataPipe line that cleans, organizes, stores and vizualizes the e-commerces orders in **AWS**.

### Intern at Scora Labs

Also worked as a **RAG model developer intern at Scora Labs** for 1 month, where I developed RAG model that performs similarity search from MongoDB vectorDB and uses that content as context to generate the **Topic tags and Difficuly level** of questions in online-examination platforms. This reduced burden of manual tagging of each question.
